# Getting Started

The `baton-sdk` is a collection of libraries and helpers to help you work with upstream services and gather relevant authentication and authorization data.

See the [example](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton-demo) for more details.

# Contributing, Support and Issues

We started Baton because we were tired of taking screenshots and manually building spreadsheets. We welcome contributions and ideas, no matter how small -- our goal is to make identity and permissions sprawl less painful for everyone. If you have questions, problems, or ideas: Please open a Github Issue!

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/ConductorOne/baton/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
